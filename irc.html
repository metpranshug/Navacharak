            <a>The IRC League is Asia Biggest Robotics and Coding League that aims to celebrate Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and make innovation an area of passion for the young minds of the developing world.<b>Mission Planet</b>
            This year's IRC Theme is that of Mission Planet. It's no surprise that COVID 19 has been the biggest impact that our planet and its inhabitants (the humankind) had in the last 100 years. This year's theme will be on how to tackle it using machines and Robots as we know that they do not get impacted by the same. So we are looking for Roboticist Superheroes who can make some Robots to aid our battle against Corona Virus and be crowned as Roboticist Superhero!
